<h1>History of Dunder Mifflin Incorporated</h1>

<p>Two best friends; Robert Mifflin and Robert Dunder; met in college and decided the world needed more paper</p>
<p>It was 1949 when the company was established as Dunder Mifflin Incorporated</p>
<p>The two would've been successful partners, but Mifflin thought that the paper company was just "tearable" and decided enough was enough and left peacefully</p>
